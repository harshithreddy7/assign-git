• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
When submitting your project to the GitHub repository, the 
gitignore file informs git which files to ignore.
for java .class, .jar, can be included.
.class is a file which we get after we execute a .java file.
we donot deal with the byte code we only deal with the source code.


• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
So, when we push our code into the remote repository, 
it is given an id that serves as a pointer to it, 
and when we create branches and reach a point where
we wish to merge the destination branch, we simply change
the main source branch's pointer to the destination branch's pointer.


• Why should you have different branches?
To isolate the work, we create branches when we want to work on two different items.


• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Only one.
